Directory Structure
===================

Building a deb of a Python PyQt5 GUI program so you can share it with others
using a deb.

The example Python program is called simpqt. Setup the directory structure for
the program.

I created a directory called gui-deb and placed the other directories in there.

The program directory also has the revision as part of the name.

You can create the directories with a file manager or in a terminal with the
following command.
::

  mkdir -p simpqt-0.0.1/debian/source simpqt-0.0.1/man simpqt-0.0.1/src
